    <h1><center>Peacock</center></h1><hr>
    <p><b>A peacock</b> is a shiny blue bird who fans out his large colorful iridescent tail feathers, especially when he's flirting with the peahens. A peacock is a male peafowl.<i> A male peacock is more flamboyant than his female counterpart</i> â€” he's the one with those long brilliant tail feathers marked with eye-like designs.<br><br><b>Peacocks</b> are ground-feeders that eat insects, plants, and small creatures. There are two familiar peacock species. The blue peacock <u>lives in India and Sri Lanka</u>, while the green peacock is found in <u> Java and Myanmar (Burma)</u>. A more distinct and little-known species, the Congo peacock, inhabits African rain forests.
